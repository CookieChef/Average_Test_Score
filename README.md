# Average_Test_Score

As a teacher I want an average score calculator, so I can determine the average of a student. 

Given x number of scroes (only # between 0 - 100) are entered. When I enter -1 then it completed and displays the average score with 2 decimal points. 

The application will continue to run allowing the user to pick what to do next.
